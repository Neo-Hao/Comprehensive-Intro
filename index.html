			<h2>What we know about learning programming</h2>

			<p>Tackling programming problems is like designing a building. Experts tend to use top-down and broad-first strategies, just like qualified architects start the building design with big structures. In contrast, novices tend to use bottom-up and narrow-first strategies, just like crazy architects somehow decide to work on the ventilation system first, regardless of the what the building structure will be. The failure to see the big picture and use top-down strategies makes it difficult to view problems out of the particular contexts, and impossible to single out universal solutions to certain problem patterns.</p>

			<h2>What we know about online help seeking</h2>

			<p>College students regularly meet problems or challenges that they can not conquer independently in learning and practicing. Effective help seeking can not only help solving problems, but also strengthening just-in-time learning. However, human helpers are not always accessible, and many students do not want to seek help from others due to self-esteem threat issues.</p>

			<p>Internet is always accessible with abundant useful information and online experts from all over the world. A student can either search online to find the relevant information, or ask questions to a big professional community. However, not all students take full advantage of online help seeking. As we found in two preliminary survey studies on students taking programming courses at University of Georgia, novice students seek help online to a much lower extent than expert students.</p>

			<h2>What I hypothesized about online help seeking</h2>

			<p>To seek help online effectively, an individual needs to adapt to the working mechanism of search engines when forming his own queries, or make his or her problem descriptions easy to understand. Search engines are very unlikely to know the contexts of students' problems, while other experts online may not want to spend too much time on reading contextual information that means little to the core of a problem. Therefore, we hypothesized that the capability to decontextualize problems is very important for effective online help seeking, and facilitation on problem decontextualization can improve students' efficiency of online seeking, and thus increase their frequency of online help seeking.</p>

			<h2>Prototype of the tool facilitating online help seeking</h2>

			<p>This prototype aims at visualizing the top-down thinking process of experts in solving practical problems. Novices students can see how a big program is broken down to approachable pieces, and follow the provided links to queries targeting decontextualized small problems.</p>

			<p>Three samples from <a href="http://cs.uga.edu/directory/brad-barnes" targe="_blank"><strong>Dr. Barnes</strong></a> are used to illustrate the idea of the tool. Complete problem description and answers to the three sample problems can be found <a href="https://github.com/Neo-Hao/Comprehensive-Exam" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

			<h3>Interfaces for students</h3>

			<p>The core of the interfaces for students is the presentation of problem breakdown. The interface composes of two sections: <i>problem breakdown</i> and <i>code structure</i>.</p>

			<div class="row">
				<img src="img/breakdown.jpg" alt="Responsive image" class="img-thumbnail"> 
			</div>

			<p><strong>Problem breakdown</strong> includes a list of tasks and their subtasks as the solution to the problem. There can be as many levels of subtasks for each task. Every task/subtask can have its own links to a search query and a code snippet</p>

			<p><strong>Code structure</strong> corresponds to the tasks/subtasks of different levels. As different level of subtasks are requested to show up or hide, the code structure change accordingly.</p>

			<p>This tool can be embedded in a learning managment system, or be used to facilitate instruction in large-scale classes.</p>

			<p>The followings are the three sample problems:</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<a href="http://home.tobeneo.com/Comprehensive-Sample1/"><img src="img/student1.jpg" alt="Responsive image" class="img-thumbnail"></a>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<a href="http://home.tobeneo.com/Comprehensive-Sample2/"><img src="img/student2.jpg" alt="Responsive image" class="img-thumbnail"></a>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<a href="http://home.tobeneo.com/Comprehensive-Sample3/"><img src="img/student3.jpg" alt="Responsive image" class="img-thumbnail"></a>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h3>Interfaces for teachers</h3>

			<p>The interfaces for teachers allow teachers to input all the information that will be presented to students, as are shown in the three samples.</p>

			<p>The core interface is <a href="http://home.tobeneo.com/Comprehensive-List-Tasks/"></a>Input for Sub Tasks. This tool allows teachers to input tasks and related links to queries and code snippets, and give structure to tasks. This tool always mainstains accessibility to the database.</p>

				<div class="col-sm-4">
